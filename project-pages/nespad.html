      <h1>The NesPad</h1>
      <p class="description">
        What is the innovation we actually need?
        <br><br>
        Nespad – the notepad of the past.
        <br><br>
        A fully functional notepad with saving (<b>WOW!</b>) and 3 full fonts: normal, bold, and italic – all of which can be capitalized.
        AND you can also type all of the symbols used to make the UI.
        <br><br>
        And if that wasn’t enough for you modern folks, it even supports four different colors – though you can only change colors per line of text.

        To this day the nespad remains one of my favorite projects, it was made for the course Retro Games and Emulator Programming given by Tom Tesch.<br>
        Whilst in the beginning it was a mess to wrap my head around assembly it quickly turned into a fun puzzle of saving every possible bit to squeeze out as much usable memory as we could.<br>
        <br>For Example this is how we planned out the entirety of the saveable text. 
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>8kb</strong> total battery backed ram<br>
        Each page has 256 bytes<br>
        <strong>byte 0–251</strong> = text<br>
        <strong>bits from 252–255 (32 bits):</strong><br>
        <strong>0–17 (18 bits)</strong> = color (2 bits per line, uses the same color system as the PPU)<br>
        <strong>18–26 (9 bits)</strong> = formatting bit per line (0 = normal, 1 = left formatting)<br>
        <strong>27–31 (5 bits)</strong> = document index<br>
        <br>
        <em>Side note for the color bits:</em> the order in the bytes is a bit weird<br>
        <strong>xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx nnnn nnxx</strong><br>
        • If you look in memory, the x’s will be the color info<br>
        • First 2 bits are for line 3, second 2 for 2, then 1, and then 0<br>
        • Then in the second byte we have the first (leftmost) 2 for 7, then 6, then 5, then 4<br>
        • Rightmost bits of the third byte are assigned to line 8<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Reserved byte in zero page</strong> to store what type of text we are writing (<code>zp_text_info</code>)<br>
        <strong>bit 1–2</strong> = text type (00 = normal, 01 = bold, 10 = italic)<br>
        <strong>bit 3</strong> = is capitalized<br>
        <strong>bit 4</strong> = is on the special keyboard<br>
        <strong>bit 5–8</strong> = used to store what line we are editing (should be reset when new page is loaded)<br>
      </div>
      <p class="description">
        So as you can see we use every single bit we can to store information. <br>
        though its kind of a lie, since we dont actually use the document index.<br>
        The idea was to have different documents you could save seperately, <br>
        but this ended up being out of scope for the semester we had this course.<br>
