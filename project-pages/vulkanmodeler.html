      <h1>Vulkan Modeler</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Whilst studying at DAE we had a course called Graphics Programming 2, here we had an entire semester to make a Graphics Engine that we could render 3d objects and light in.<br>
        <br>
        I ended up deciding to make a <b>very</b> simple 3d modeler. all it was able to do was selecting vertices by clicking on them and moving them with buttons on the keyboard.
        <br><br>
        The project itself was not my proudest achievement but I'm still proud of the graphics engine part
