  <h1>GobGobKnight</h1>
  <p class="description">
    While studying at DAE, we had a course called <i>Game Projects</i> — our first structured project outside of game jams that involved a mix of programmers, artists, and an audio designer.<br>
    We were given 10 hours of dedicated work time per week over a period of 12 weeks to complete this project.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Game:</b><br>
    You play as a group of goblins who, as children, found an old storybook about a knight searching for the Holy Grail.<br>
    Naturally, this sparked an obsession with everything knight-related.<br>
    That obsession led them to scavenge any armor they could find and stuff themselves into it — beginning their own quest for the Holy Grail.
    <br><br>
    Now, they stack together, fight bandits, and search for the shiniest grail they can find.

    On this project, I naturally stepped into more of a managerial role, since I had a bit more experience with group work than the rest of the team.
    <br><br>
    I still focused heavily on my main responsibilities as a programmer — handling player movement, the head's automatic behavior, interactable world items, and the camera system.
    <br><br>
    One aspect I particularly enjoyed was developing small tools to help the artists navigate the project more easily. Since we were working in Unreal and compiling C++ code was required, I created a batch file that automatically compiled any changes and launched the project. This kept the artists out of the code environment entirely — making everyone’s lives a little easier.
