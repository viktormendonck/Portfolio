      <h1>Goblin Knight</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Whilst studying at DAE we had a course called game projects, our first project outside of Game Jams that has a mix of programmers, Artists and an audio person.<br>
        This course allowed us 10 hours of work per week to finish this project. 
        <br><br>
        The Game:<br>
        You play as a collection of goblin's that when they where younger found an old storybook about a Knight looking for the holy grail. 
        This of course lead to an infatuation with anything knight related.<br>
        This infatuation lead to them scavenging any armor they could find and stuffing themselves into it on their own quest for the holy grail.
        <br>
        now they stack together, fight bandits and look for the shiniest grail they can find.

      <p class="description">
        In this project, I naturally stepped into more of a managerial role, as I had a bit more experience with group projects than the rest of the team.
        <br>
        Alongside that, I also focused on my main responsibilities as a programmer; <br>
        handling player movement, the head's automatic behavior, interactable items in the world, and the camera system.
        <br><br>
        One aspect I particularly enjoyed was developing small tools to help the artists navigate the project more easily. Since we were working in Unreal and the C++ code needed to be compiled, I created a batch file that automatically compiled any changes and then launched the project. This kept the artists out of the code environment entirely — which made everyone’s lives a little easier.
