      <p class="description">
        This game is the result of a gamejam with the theme:"It Spreads"
        <br><br>
        When thinking of it spreads we ended up at the idea for spreading color to a grayed out world.
        <br> This together with a platformer style game ended up being the entire idea.
        <br><br>On this project my job ended up being all of the movement and all other gameplay whilst the other programmer figured out the shader needed for the coloring in.

        The biggest struggle with a game like this was figuring out how to make it clear which areas where possible to land on and which weren't.<br> The trick would be to make something distinct in both grayscale and saturated, and in our case, we really failed.
