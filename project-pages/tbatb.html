      <h1>The Boy and the Brush</h1>
  <p class="description">
    This game is the result of a game jam with the theme: <i>"It Spreads."</i>
    <br><br>
    When thinking about <i>"it spreads"</i>, we came up with the idea of spreading color into a grayed-out world.
    <br> This, combined with a <i>platformer-style</i> game, became the core concept.
    <br><br>In this project, my role involved handling all the <b>movement</b> and <b>gameplay mechanics</b>, while the other programmer focused on the <b>shader</b> required for coloring the world.

  <p class="description">
    The biggest challenge in a game like this was figuring out how to clearly distinguish which areas were safe to land on and which weren’t. <br> The solution was to make something distinct in both <i>grayscale</i> and <i>saturated colors</i>, but in our case, we didn’t quite succeed.
