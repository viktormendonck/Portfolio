      <h1>CppDigger</h1>
      <p class="description">
        This game is the result of the course Programming 4, this course went over the basics of making a game engine and a bunch of Design patterns in C++.
        <br><br>
        When we got to the halfway point of the semester the teachers revealed what game we would have to make, in my case it was Digger(1983).
        <br><br>
        The biggest issue I ended up facing on the game's side was figuring out how to render the world being dug.<br> I'm pretty sure that the first few versions of the tile decision logic was the most abhorant code I had ever written. Luckily I ended up replacing it with some binary logic was quite clean.
