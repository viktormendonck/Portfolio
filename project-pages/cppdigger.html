      <p class="description">
        This game is the result of the Programming 4 course, which covered the basics of building a game engine and several design patterns in C++.
        <br><br>
        Halfway through the semester, the teachers revealed which game we’d be recreating—in my case, it was <i>Digger</i> (1983).
        <br><br>
        The biggest challenge I faced during development was figuring out how to render the world as it was being dug.<br>
        I’m pretty sure that the first few versions of the tile decision logic were the most abominable code I’d ever written. Luckily, I eventually replaced it with some binary logic that turned out to be surprisingly clean.
