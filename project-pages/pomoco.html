      <h1><b>Poseidon's Moving Company</b></h1>
  <p class="description">
    Moving out is tough. 
    <br><br>
    Doing it underwater as a shark? That’s even harder. 
    <br><br>
    But you know what’s even more challenging? Working for <b>Poseidon's Moving Company</b> (<i>Pomoco™</i>) and having to juggle all of that — as a shark — under intense time pressure. What are you gonna do? Grab the furniture with your hands?

  <p class="description">
    This was my first start-to-finish game, created with a mix of friends and strangers.<br>
    My best friend convinced me to try <b>Godot</b> as the game engine, and it turned out to be much nicer than I expected.
    <br><br>
    The most important lesson I learned from this project was the concept of "<i>Scope Creep</i>." Who would’ve thought that generating levels randomly would be so challenging? <br>
    It also taught me the reality of working under a time limit. Before this, I could always “put in more hours”, but facing an actual deadline was an eye-opening experience.
