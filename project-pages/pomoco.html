      <h1>Posseidon's Moving Company</h1>
      <p class="description">
        You know what isn't easy? Moving out. 
        <br><br>
        You know what's hard? Doing it underwater as a shark. 
        <br><br>
        But do you know what's even harder? Working for Poseidon's Moving Company (Pomoco™) and having to do all of that, as a shark, under way too much time pressure. What are you gonna do? Grab the furniture with your hands?

            My first start-to-finish game that I made with some friends and strangers.<br>
            My best friend convinced me to try Godot as a game engine, which was nicer than expected.
            <br><br>
            The main thing I ended up learning from this project was the concept of "Scope Creep", because who would have thunk that trying to generate the levels completely randomly would be difficult. <br>
            This really showed me that a time limit is actually a thing, before this I could always just "put in more hours" so getting a constraint like that was an eye opening experience.
